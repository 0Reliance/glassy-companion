- **Keyboard Shortcut** — `Ctrl+Shift+N` / `⌘+Shift+N` opens the popup straight to Note view.
- **Popup Redesign** — Tabbed interface (Save / Note / Search) with a cleaner component architecture.
- **Logout Safety** — Warns before signing out if offline queue has unsaved items.
- **Error Handling** — Network failures, rate limits (429), and edge cases handled across all API calls.

### Previous: v1.1.0 (March 9, 2026)

- **Save All Tabs** — Save every open HTTP/HTTPS tab in one click. Already-saved duplicates (matched by URL) are detected and skipped automatically.
- **Quick Search** — Search your Glassy Keep bookmarks inline directly in the popup. Results appear as you type without needing to open the dashboard.

## Configuration

After installing, click the Glassy Companion icon and enter:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Glassy URL** | The full URL of your Glassy instance (e.g. `https://dash.example.com`) |
| **Username / Password** | Your Glassy account credentials |

The extension stores your session token in `chrome.storage.session` (cleared when the browser closes) and your profile cache in `chrome.storage.local`. Credentials are never sent anywhere except your own Glassy server.

**Host permissions** are scoped to your Glassy instance URL only. No data is sent to third-party servers.

---

## Multi-Account Support

If your Glassy instance runs v2.1.0+, the extension automatically supports multi-account workspaces:

- When you switch accounts in the Glassy dashboard, the extension picks up the active account.
- All saves, searches, and tag lookups are scoped to the active account via the `X-Account-Id` header.
- Account limits depend on your subscription tier: Free (1), Paid (3), Lifetime (5).

## AI Provider

AI features (auto-tagging, page summaries) use whichever AI provider is configured in your Glassy instance — Google Gemini, Z.AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, or local Ollama. No additional configuration is needed in the extension.
